\section{Introduction}

\subsection{A Subsection}

Please make sure that your paper contains correct reference
sequence (please resort them according to its {\it alphabetical
order} and make sure that each bibliographical item is labelled
and that these items are recalled using the command
\verb|\cite{...}|, such as \cite{LT}, and \cite{HB,T1,T2,T3})

All equations, theorems, definitions, lemmas, propositions,
corollaries, examples, remarks etc. would be better to be numbered
consecutively and unrepeatedly within each section. For example,
Definition 2.1, Lemma 2.2, Theorem 2.3 \ldots.

Use \verb|\label| and \verb|\ref| or \verb|\eqref| to
automatically cross-reference sections, equations, theorems and
theorem-like environments, tables, figures, etc.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{HB}]\label{th:1.1} %Theorem 1.1 could be recalled by using Theorem \ref{th:1.1}
The statements of theorems, lemmas, definitions, propositions,
corollaries, conjectures, etc. are set in italics, by using
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{theorem/lemma/definition/proposition/corollary/conjecture}
\end{theorem/lemma/definition/proposition/corollary/conjecture}.
\end{verbatim}
\end{theorem}

\begin{prof}  %you can also use the environment \begin{proof}\end{proof}
Observe that
\begin{align}\label{E:1.1}
AAAAAAAAAA &= BBBBBBBBBBB\nonumber \\
           &\quad + CCCCCCCCCC\nonumber \\
           &= DDDDDDDDDDDDD.
\end{align}
Now apply induction on $n$ to \eqref{E:1.1}\ldots
\end{prof}

\begin{remark}\label{re:1.2}
Remarks, examples, problems, etc. are set in roman type.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Table}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|l|c|}
\hline $P(x)$ & $i$& $(e(1),e(2),e(4))$ & $(e(3),e(6),e(12),e(24))$ & $T(E)$ \\
\hline $P_1$  &    & & &$\emptyset$ \\
